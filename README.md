## Known Issues

- Saving files with ini-entries which require custom order within the same ini-section are not yet supported. This includes the following files:
-- Mission Encounters (missions\encounters\*.ini)
-- Missions (missions\\m\.ini)
-- Solar Asteroids (solar\asteroids\*.ini)
-- Solar Nebulae (solar\nebula\*.ini)
    
- All ini sections or entries with invalid names will be ignored and therefore are not written on save. See the shipped Template.xml file for a complete list. However you can easily edit this file which is located in the same directory as the .exe to change this behavior.
